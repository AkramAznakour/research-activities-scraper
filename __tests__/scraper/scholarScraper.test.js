          "               Actually, a set of ETL software (Extract, Transform and Load) is available to constitute a major investment market. Each ETL uses its own techniques for extracting, transforming and loading data into data warehouse, which makes the task of evaluating ETL software very difficult. However, choosing the right software of ETL is critical to the success or failure of any Business Intelligence project. As there are many impacting factors in the selection of ETL software, the same process is considered as a complex multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem. In this study, an application of decision-making methodology that employs the two well-known MCDM techniques, namely Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) methods is designed. In this respect, the aim of using AHP is to analyze the structure of the ETL software selection problem …",

          "               Landfill location selection is a multi-criteria decision problem and has a strategic importance for many regions. The conventional methods for landfill location selection are insufficient in dealing with the vague or imprecise nature of linguistic assessment. To resolve this problem, fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making methods are proposed. The aim of this paper is to use fuzzy TODIM (the acronym for Interactive and Multi-criteria Decision Making in Portuguese) and the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) methods for the selection of landfill location. The proposed methods have been applied to a landfill location selection problem in the region of Casablanca, Morocco. After determining the criteria affecting the landfill location decisions, fuzzy TODIM and fuzzy AHP methods are applied to the problem and results are presented. The comparisons of these two methods are also discussed.",

          "               This study aims to propose a decision-making approach combining multi-criteria analysis and fuzzy logic within the online analytical processing data cube model (OLAP). Indeed, most decision-making systems are based on models of operational research. These models are often composed of quantitative data and postulate the existence of a single objective function (criterion) representing the preferences of decision-makers. However, in reality, we are faced with a more complex situation where several criteria (quantitative and/or qualitative) should be taken into account. It is therefore natural to consider different types of data (more criteria) in the design of OLAP cubes and decision-making systems. Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) combined with fuzzy sets theory offers an efficient approach to solve complex decision problems. So we believe it is useful and necessary to envisage, for OLAP cubes, an …",

However, this process contains many methods that require many time-consuming calculations depending on the number of criteria, alternatives and decision-makers in order to reach the optimal solution. In this study, a web-based FMCGDM framework that offers decision-makers a fast and reliable response service is proposed. The proposed framework includes commonly used tools for multi-criteria decision-making problems such as fuzzy Delphi, fuzzy AHP and fuzzy TOPSIS methods.

          "At present, many organizations try to gain value from their exponential growth of data by implementing new available technologies, processes and governance mechanisms, such as big data and Cloud computing. According to Gartner and Mackinsey predictions, big data has been largely adopted in 2013. Effectively, nowadays the challenge now is how to ensure an effective analysis and management of large-scale data by minimizing all the costs related to accessing and processing those data. The huge commitment of hardware and processing resources often needed when using big data, is one of the limitations that must be taken into consideration. Since the technology is permanently subject to advances and development, the question for many businesses is how they can benefit from big data using the power of technique flexibility that Cloud computing can provide. In this paper, we propose a decisional methodology based on Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and PROMETHEE (Preference Ranking Organization METHod for Enrichment Evaluations) for comparing, ranking and selecting the most suitable Cloud computing to accommodate and access big data. Due to the varying importance of the used criteria, we develop fuzzy AHP software based on extent analysis method to assign the importance weights to evaluation criteria, while the PROMETHEE process exploits these weighted criteria as input to evaluate and rank the decision alternatives.",

        Description:
          "This paper discusses the intake of combining multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) with OLAP systems, to generate an integrated analysis process dealing with complex multi-criteria decision-making situations. In this context, a multi-agent modeling is presented for decision support systems by combining multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) with OLAP systems. The proposed modeling which consists in performing the multi-agent system (MAS) architecture, procedure and protocol of the negotiation model is elaborated as a decision support tool for complex decision-making environments. Our objective is to take advantage from the multiagent system which distributes resources and computational capabilities across interconnected agents, and provide a problem modeling in terms of autonomous interacting component-agents. Thus, the identification and evaluation of criteria as well as the evaluation and ranking of alternatives in a decision support situation will be performed by organizing tasks and user preferences between different agents in order to reach the right decision. At the end, an illustrative example is conducted to demonstrate the function and effectiveness of our MAS modeling.",

        Description:
          "Currently, most spatial decision support systems are based on models that take into account one criteria functions representing the preferences of decision makers. However, they are often faced with complex situations. Since only one function cannot adequately capture all the information necessary for the decision making process, it is natural that we consider the MCDA (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis) as a tool for integrating multiple decision criteria. The MCDA suggests methods that provide the ability to accommodate a variety of conflicting factors. In this paper, we propose an approach of decision making support that is based on linking the MCDA to the SOLAP process (Spatial Online Analytical Processing), an essential component of the spatial decision support systems analysis. The testing of SOLAP process demonstrated that there exists a shortage in the consideration of the multicriteria aspect. Therefore, it …",

        Description:
          "The decisions support Systems are based on decision technologies enabling organizations to make better use of their data flow analysis by simplifying them. Indeed, OLAP (On Line Analytical Processing) tools such as decisional technology, offer the possibility of archiving, management, analysis and multidimensional modeling. However, they are limited in the consideration of the multicriteria and quality aspect of the decision problem. To overcome these limitations, we proposed in this research, a methodological approach for integrating multicriteria analysis in OLAP systems. Our aim of this approach is to create a hybrid model of data (OLAP / MCA), which will expand the capabilities of OLAP through the contribution of MCA as a tool for multi-criteria analysis. In order to validate our contribution, we present the results of experiments showing the efficiency and performance of our approach.",

          "The Geospatial Business Intelligence (Geo-BI) is a collection of technologies that combines Geographic Information System (GIS) and Business Intelligence (BI). Geo-BI provides an efficient tool for browsing and storing very large spatio-temporal databases. However, the process for evaluation and selection of the optimal decision in Geo-BI is very complex. Hence, the Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods are used as a tool to facilitate the decision making process. In this paper, we present a methodology called Multi-Criteria Geospatial Business Intelligence (MC-GeoBI) which aims to enhance Geo-BI applications by applying MCDM. The latter obviously offers several advantages in terms of decision making when one must take into account the multiple and contradictory aspects of the criteria. To illustrate this, an application model has been developed to select the most appropriate site for landfill of industrial wastes.",
